# HackerrankAutomation

This project challenges the idea that website ratings and the number of questions solved reflect real talent and knowledge in programming. By automating code submissions on platforms like HackerRank, it aims to demonstrate that true expertise involves deep understanding and problem-solving skills, not just completing tasks quickly.

## Automated HackerRank Challenge Solver using Puppeteer

### Overview

This repository contains a Puppeteer script designed to automate solving HackerRank coding challenges. The script logs into HackerRank, navigates to the Algorithms section, selects warm-up challenges, and solves them programmatically. It mimics human interactions by entering login credentials, clicking buttons, selecting challenges, interacting with code editors, and submitting solutions.

### Key Features

- **Login Automation**
  - Automates login to HackerRank using provided credentials.

- **Challenge Selection**
  - Navigates to specific challenge categories and selects challenges.

- **Code Editor Interaction**
  - Automates interactions with HackerRank's code editor to input and submit solutions.

- **Efficiency**
  - Utilizes Puppeteer's capabilities to simulate user actions and handle asynchronous interactions.

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RiyaHablani/HackerrankAutomation.git
2. **Navigate into the cloned repository:**

     cd HackerrankAutomation
3. **Install dependencies:**

    -npm init
    -npm install puppetter
4. **Update codeObj:**
   
    Edit code.js to include your answers or solutions.

6.  **Run the script:**
   
     node hackerrank_automation.js
### Watch as it automates solving challenges on HackerRank.
